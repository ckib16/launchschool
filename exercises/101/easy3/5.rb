# Squaring an Argument
#
# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).
#
# Example:
#
# square(5) == 25
# square(-8) == 64

def square(num1)
  square_result = num1 * num1  # => 9
end                            # => :square

square(3) == 9  # => true
